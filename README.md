# MongoDB $inc Operator Error with String Value
This example demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update operations. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numeric field by a specified value.  However, providing a string value instead of a number will lead to an error.
The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the correct implementation.
